# Fraud Detection - End-to-End Machine Learning Project

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project aims to build a **fraud detection system** for **e-commerce and banking transactions**.  
It includes **data preprocessing, model training, explainability, API development, and a dashboard**.

## ðŸ“‚ Datasets
- `Fraud_Data.csv` - E-commerce transaction data with fraud labels.
- `IpAddress_to_Country.csv` - Maps IP addresses to country locations.
- `creditcard.csv` - Credit card transaction data (with PCA-transformed features).

---

## ðŸ“Œ **Task 1: Data Analysis & Preprocessing**
### âœ… **Steps Performed**
- **Handled missing values** using imputation techniques.
- **Removed duplicates** and corrected data types.
- **Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand fraud trends.
- **Merged datasets** to include **geolocation data** from IP addresses.
- **Engineered new features** such as:
  - **Transaction frequency**
  - **Time-based features** (hour of day, day of week)
- **Normalized numerical features** and **encoded categorical variables**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ **Task 2: Model Training**
### âœ… **Steps Performed**
- **Split data** into **training (80%)** and **testing (20%)** sets.
- **Trained multiple models**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
  - Neural Networks (MLP)
- **Evaluated models** using:
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC
- **Used MLflow** for **experiment tracking and model versioning**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ **Task 3: Model Explainability**
### âœ… **Steps Performed**
- Used **SHAP** (Shapley Additive Explanations) to:
  - Identify **important features** contributing to fraud detection.
  - Generate **SHAP Summary, Force, and Dependence plots**.
- Used **LIME** (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to:
  - Explain **individual fraud predictions**.
  - Generate **Feature Importance plots** for better interpretability.

---

## ðŸ“Œ **Task 4: Model Deployment & API Development**
### âœ… **Steps Performed**
- Built a **Flask API** to serve fraud predictions.
- API supports **real-time predictions** using a trained model.
- Created a **Dockerfile** to containerize the API.
- Steps to **build and run the Docker container**:
  ```bash
  docker build -t fraud-detection-api .
  docker run -p 5000:5000 fraud-detection-api


## ðŸ“Œ **Task 5: Dashboard Devlopment**

This task focuses on building an **interactive dashboard** to visualize fraud detection insights using **Dash (Plotly)**.  
The dashboard provides **real-time analytics** on fraudulent transactions, trends, and distribution.

## ðŸŽ¯ Features
âœ… Display **total transactions, fraud cases, and fraud percentage**.  
âœ… Visualize **fraud trends over time** using a **line chart**.  
âœ… Analyze **fraud occurrences across devices and browsers** using bar charts.
